### Introduction
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Look for the *Run* button, which is a green, right facing triangle shaped icon on the right side of the code chunk.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

You'll notice all of the formatting used here with the text. This is *Markdown* formatting, which is a lightweight markup syntax that RStudio increasingly utilizes to produce reproducible research products. You can find out all about Markdown by checking out [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Data
Today, we'll use two data sources for our class. The examples we'll discuss come from [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com). The [data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) was originally used for [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/do-pulitzers-help-newspapers-keep-readers/) that investigated whether [Pulitzer Prizes](http://www.pulitzer.org) helped newspapers keep readers.

```{r}
prize <- read.csv("pulitzer-circulation-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Pay close attention to the structure of the code above. We've assigned the data in the `csv` file to an object named `prize`. We use the `read.csv()` function to do this. You *must* place the filename in quotes

Now, practice writing this code on the other dataset in the seminar's directory: `auto2016.csv`. These data come from the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) and have been extensively cleaned by Chris.

```{r}

```

### Exploring the Dataset

#### The View Function
We can open up a tabular view of the data using the view function:
```{r}
View(prize)
```

Now try opening up that view with the automobile data:
```{r}

```


#### The Structure Function

The variables within `prize` are visible in the environment tab. You can also get a table that summarizes your variables using the structure function - `str()`.

```{r}
str(prize)
```

Note that you can see the variable names, their data types (`chr` for character and `int` for integer, a particular type of numeric variable), and some examples of the data they contain.

Now try using the structure function on the automobile data:

```{r}

```

#### Confirming Data Types

There are ways to automatically confirm the types of variables that you have. For example, we can test whether `Newspaper` is a character or numeric variable:

```{r}
is.numeric(prize$Newspaper)
is.character(prize$Newspaper)
```

Note that the output follows the order of the commands. So line 1 corresponds with command 1, and line 2 corresponds with command 2.

Now, using the automobile data, test whether the variable `brand` is numeric or character:

```{r}

```

#### Looking at Individual Observations

We can use two functions - `head()` and `tail()` - to look at the first 6 and last 6 observations of a dataset. Note that presence of the black right facing triangle icon on the right side of the table. You can use that to scroll right to view more columns.

```{r}
head(prize)
```

```{r}
tail(prize)
```

Now, use the `head()` and `tail()` functions to explore the automobile data.

Head of the automobile dataset:
```{r}

```

Tail of the automobile dataset:
```{r}

```

#### RStudio Output
Everytime you save your RNotebook, an `html` file will automatically be generated containing all of your output. You can view it from within RStudio, or open it using a web browser. You can also use the Knit button to create a `pdf` of your results. 

Try this for the automobile dataset.
