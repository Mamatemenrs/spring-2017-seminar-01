### Introduction
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Look for the *Run* button, which is a green, right facing triangle shaped icon on the right side of the code chunk.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

### Data
Today, we'll use two data sources for 

```{r}
auto2016 <- read.csv(auto2016.csv, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
